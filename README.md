## This is me

My name is not hard to guess, I'll leave that as an exercise to the interested reader. Instead, here's a few things you may or may not want to know about me:
- born and raised in Italy 🇮🇹, now based in Austria 🇦🇹
- level 29 human nerd at the time of writing this, probably horribly outdated by the time of you reading it 🧓
- hold a Master's degree in Mathematics 👨‍🏫
- self-taught programmer 💻
- data scientist by profession 👨‍💻
- based on my way of life, habits and hobbies, my ancestors include:
  - a mountain goat 🐐 (I spend most of my summer bouncing around different summits of the beautiful Austrian Alps)
  - a vampire 🦇 (my sleep schedule is routinely messed up, and not for a lack of trying to get on a healthy cycle)
  - someone with a surname that ends in -sen (I'm an avid 🏸 player)

## This is my code

My tech stack is mostly Python (to the point I am jokingly referring to myself as a snake charmer 🐍). Notable frameworks I work with include:
- most common data science libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow/keras), for obvious job-related reasons
- Django
- FastAPI
- Dash
- the entire async side of Python

Less notable ones are:
- discord.py/py-cord
- coc.py (I actually am one of the maintainers for it)
- RabbitMQ/aio-pika

I am a huge `functools` and `collections` fanboy, I believe decorators to be the coolest thing under the sun, and I won't let anyone tell me Python doesn't
have the best stdlib of all programming languages by a landslide. Other languages I have dabbled in include JavaScript and C++, and I want to add Rust to
that list some time in the not so distant future. My preferred database is PostgreSQL 🐘, for other applications, I really like Redis and ClickHouse. I am
also reasonably proficient with Docker, GitHub Actions and Kubernetes to round out the DevOps side of my skill tree.

## This is my proudest achievement

In terms of coding, my proudest achievement, my favorite brain-child, without a shadow of a doubt is [League Utils](https://leagueutils.com), a Discord-based
platform to host Clash of Clans tournaments on. It does everything (pretty much literally - you name it, I have probably built it), and its roughly 250 different 
commands allow tournament admins to manage the entire lifecycle of their events, starting with signups, mid-season team and roster management, match management,
standings, automated playoff generation, fairplay infrastructure and a bunch of other things I don't want to list right now. If you're curious, I have linked the
website above, go have a look for yourself. Other than that website, League Utils also comes with a Discord bot (duh), and an API (explains that random portion of
my tech stack), and its 50k+ lines of code are the result of soon to be five years of development, and I have no intentions to stop. Right now (again, at the time
of writing this. When you read this, I'll hopefully be done), I rewriting the entirety of those 50k+ lines to change the architecture from a monolithical one to a
microservice grid.
